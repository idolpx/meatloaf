/*
This is the main IEC named channel abstraction. Meatloaf keeps an array/map of these as long as they're alive
and removes them when channel is closed

- each named channel is connected to one file

- it allows pushing data to/from remote file

- when ATN is received the transfer stops and will be seamlesly resumed on next call to send/receive

- resuming transfer is possible as long as this channel is open

Example usage:

// c64 requests a remote file "http://address/file.prg"
auto newPipe = new iecPipe();
newPipe->establish("http://address/file.prg", std::ios_base::openmode::_S_in, iec);

// store the pipe in your table of channels
.....

// start transfer
newPipe->readFile();
// this method returns only when either happened:
// 1) the file was read wholly so you have to call newPipe->finish() and remove it from your table of channles
// 2) ATN was pulled, so if reading from this channel is later requested again, you fetch it from
//    your table of channels and call: 
//    storedPipe->readFile()
//    you can readFile() as many times as needed, and it will do what you expect (resume from where it was interrupted)
//    as long as it stays open and not EOF.


_S_out == C64 -> IEC -> file
_S_in  == file -> IEC -> C64
